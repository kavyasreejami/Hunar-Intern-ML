Breast Cancer Prediction using KNN
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is "breast cancer.csv," which contains features extracted from breast mass images. The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict whether the breast mass is benign or malignant.

Steps
1. Import Libraries
First, we import essential libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, sklearn for machine learning, and matplotlib for visualization.

2. Load Dataset
The dataset is read from a CSV file using pandas. This dataset contains several features that describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the breast mass images.

3. Data Preprocessing
We check for any missing values in the dataset. If there are null values, we handle them appropriately. Then, we split the dataset into features (X) and target (Y).

4. Split Data
We split the data into training and testing sets. This allows us to evaluate the performance of our model on unseen data.

5. Standardize Features
The features are standardized using StandardScaler. Standardization is crucial for KNN as it ensures that all features contribute equally to the distance calculations.

6. Cross-Validation
We perform cross-validation to determine the best value of k for the KNN classifier. Cross-validation helps in selecting the optimal hyperparameters by evaluating the model on multiple subsets of the training data.

7. Model Training
Using the best k value obtained from cross-validation, we train the KNN classifier on the training set.

8. Model Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated on both the training and testing sets. This step helps in understanding how well the model generalizes to new data.

9. Performance Metrics
We calculate various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into the performance of the model.

10. Classification Report
A detailed classification report is generated, which includes precision, recall, F1 score, and support for each class. This report gives a comprehensive view of the model's performance.

11. Predictions
Finally, we display the true and predicted labels for the test set. This helps in understanding the model's predictions and identifying any misclassifications
